This is a file that you might send through gmail.

You can use HTML like the following:

<img src="https://ee5817f8e2e9a2e34042-3365e7f0719651e5b8d0979bce83c558.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/python.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

Note that when this message is sent, it is wrapped in a <pre></pre>, which has the effect of preserving spacing.  This means you can send messages like the following through the program and it will show up correctly:

        _ ._  _ , _ ._
      (_ ' ( `  )_  .__)
    ( (  (    )   `)  ) _)
   (__ (_   (_ . _) _) ,__)
       `~~`\ ' . /`~~`
       ,::: ;   ; :::,
      ':::::::::::::::'
